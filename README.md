# ViewHex

## Wat?

This is a simple hex viewer made in Haskell that uses ncurses.

## Compiling

This program is written in Haskell. If you don't already have Haskell, I'd recommend getting Haskell Platform.
You also need to install the ncurses library and install the Haskell ncurses package, which provides bindings to the ncurses library


Then run
```
ghc ViewHex.hs
```

## Usage

The usage is as follows
```
./ViewHex [in file]
```
You would replace the "./Main" with "Main.exe" if you are using Windows prompts
